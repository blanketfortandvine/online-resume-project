<h3>Summary of Objective</h3>
  <p>I am an avid creator and designer with burgeoning web design and development aspirations, in particular in creative and e-commerce ventures. I am ready to storm the internet on a shaky foundation of coding pitfalls and surprising eurekas. I've recently experienced work injury requiring a complete revision of my career path, which does follow a kind of amazing progression. I have a background in fine art, theatre, and graphic design, alongside floral and event design. Most recently, my own e-commerce side hustle has been invaluable in teaching me the wonders and hellscape of internet entrepreneurship. Joy and pain are excellent teachers. Coding is really fun.</p>
